The Story of the Monkey And the Crocodile

PARA-1

Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived on a berry tree, on the banks of a river. 
In the same forest lived a crocodile and his wife.
 One day, 
the crocodile wanders deep into the river and comes to rest under the berry tree, on which the monkey lived.

PARA-2

The crocodile, having swum up quite a distance, was tired and hungry. 
The kind monkey sees that the crocodile is hungry and shares the berries with the crocodile. 
The crocodile eats the sweet berries, thanks the monkey, and goes back home.

PARA-3
(FLIPED STORY)

She thought of a wicked plan and said, “The berries are lovely.
 I’m happy that you shared them with me. 
 Why didn’t you tell about it sooner?” 
 And then she added, 
 “If the berries are so sweet, I wonder how sweet the monkey’s heart would be, 
 given that he eats these berries every day?”
